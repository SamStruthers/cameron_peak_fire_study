purpose: early development of Landsat C2 stack acquisition, grab temp stacks for Sam's upcoming presentation to the Cache la Poudre Foundation presentation.

Cache La Poudre lakes satellite-derived temperature estimates for 8 lakes - see the file 'CLP_flagged_SurfTemp_Landsat5-9_v02Dec2022.csv' for the data to be used in analyses. 

A few notes: 
'upper_poudre_lakes.csv' was used as a lake location dataset - these were adjusted from the original file sent from Sam to be closer to the 'center' of the lake and to be reflective of WGS84 datum
'LandsatC2Stacks.qmd' just inlcuding this to document the settings used to grab the temp stack.
The 'CPF_SufTemp_...' files are the original output from the LandsatC2Stacks.qmd, copied from my Drive. 

Read through the SurfTemp_PostProcess.qmd for details on the anomaly field. Quickly, the anomaly column is a quick assessment of whether or not the reported temp value is an anomaly or not. I suggest only using the temp data that are flagged in this column as 'No' anomaly. 

column definitions:
"Name" - reservoir name, same as the Name in the 'upper_poudre_lakes.csv' file 
"date" - data of satellite image acquisition; YYYY-MM-DD format
"SurfTemp_degC" - median surface temperature of the water in degrees Celcius
"anomaly" - indication of wether the data point is considered an anomaly ('Yes' = anomaly, 'No' = no anomaly, 'notEnoughData' = no assessment can be made about the data point because there is not a high enough density of data to determine anomalies)
"SurfTemp" - median surface temperature of the water in degrees Kelvin
"sd_SurfTempSD" - standard deviation of the mean of the pixels contributing to the median value
"min_SurfTempMin" - minimum surface temperature of the water in degrees Kelvin
"max_SurfTempMax" - maximum surface temperature of the water in degrees Kelvin
"pCount_SurfTemp" - number of pixels contributing the the median value
"system.index" - character string of identifying information pertinent to the Landast scene and feature id (lake)
"LSMission" - Landsat mission that obtained the image
"PR" - WRS2 path row of the Landsat acquisition
"comid" - comid, same as the comid listed in the 'upper_poudre_lakes.csv' file
"gnis_id" - GNIS ID, same as the comid listed in the 'upper_poudre_lakes.csv' file
"Lat" - latitude (WGS84) in decimal degrees of the location
"Long" - longitude (WGS84) in decimal degrees of the location
